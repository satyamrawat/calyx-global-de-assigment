The landfill is owned by the municipality of Caucaia and operated since 2003 by ECOFOR, under a 20 year concession. The site property covers 116 hectares (ha), of which 84.1ha have been designated for waste disposal and is divided in 6 different disposal areas.\n\nPreviously to the implementation of the proposed CDM Project Activity no active collection of LFG took place in the project site. On the contrary, only a small portion of the gas was destructed using a passive venting system\n\nThe proposed CDM Project Activity consists of capturing the landfill gas (LFG) generated by the landfill using an active LFG capture system and injecting it into a natural gas distribution network (after a purification process), displacing the use of natural gas. Any LFG excess will be flared. GNR Fortaleza Valorização de Biogás Ltda., which is the project activity implementer, understands that flaring shall be always the very last option of any CDM project related to LFG destruction.\n\nThe project activity is expected to have 7,500Nm3/h processing capacity. Depending on the project performance up to 2017, a second and third phase may be implemented. Then, 12,500Nm3/h processing capacity may be achieved from 2018 to 2028 (phase II) and 15,000 Nm3/h in 2029 onwards (phase III). Then, the estimated emission reductions considered this expansion scenario, resulting in an annual average 498,097 tCO2e/yr. By the end of the first crediting period, the project is expected to reduce on total 3,486,678 tCO2e.\n\nThe Oeste de Caucaia Landfill Project Activity will have a substantial positive impact in terms of sustainable development as it will be one of the first projects that purify the LFG and injects it to a network distribution grid being developed in Brazil that, as consequence, directly displaces natural gas.\nAn environmental benefit with the implementation of the Oeste de Caucaia Landfill Project is the destruction of methane that otherwise would be emitted to the atmosphere, increasing the impact on global warming. Despite of being possibly flared if necessary, the landfill gas collected will be primarily injected (after the upgrading process) into the natural gas distribution grid, therefore avoiding the consumption of natural gas.\n\n"},

Methane in the LFG has been emitted to the atmosphere since the landfill started operation. Therefore, the proposed project activity avoids methane emissions and, at the same time, electricity is generated from a renewable energy source, instead of being provided by the grid.\n"},

Our focus lies in distributing ceramic candle water filters, impregnated with silver nanoparticles and filled with activated carbon, specifically targeting low-income households in both rural and urban areas. This effort is facilitated through a network of resellers and microfinance institutions (MFIs). The core objective is to make affordable Nazava Water Filters available, capable of effectively removing contaminants and ensuring the delivery of safe drinking water to households and institutions. The project is large-scale and has a duration of 10 years (5 years, renewable twice).\n\nThe project will involve the distribution of the Nazava Water Filter in Kenya as the planned target area for the project implementation. The project owner Nazava Water Filters Limited will do the preparation and implementation of the project.\n\nThe project addresses a critical issue in Kenya, where many people lack access to safe drinking water. This lack of access to safe drinking water leads to waterborne diseases like diarrhea, which causes significant health problems and even death, especially among children. Nazava’s ceramic filters offer a solution by providing a continuous supply of microbiologically safe drinking water. \n\nThe Nazava Water Filter, see Figure 1, is a 2x16-liter ceramic water filter with a flow speed of 2 liters per hour. The 2x16-liters ensure a full-day supply of drinking water for the whole household. The upper compartment is where the inflow of unsafe water occurs whereas the second compartment contains the filtered purified water with an outlet attached to it. The Nazava ceramic filter candle called the Nazava PROT3CT has three main working components.\nThe ceramic filter with pores of 0.4 micron filters out bacteria.\nThe nanosilver particles mixed with the ceramic kills the bacteria.\nThe activated carbon inside the ceramic improves the taste, odor and color.\n\nUsing this technology, households can filter their own tap, well, river or rainwater. All these filters come with a local language user manual with clear directions, an indicator for filter replacement and a one-year warranty card. The Nazava Water Filter has been shown to effectively reduce diarrhea diseases, with independent tests and assessments available. \n"},

R. China. It is developed by Henan BCCY Environmental Energy Co., Ltd. The collected LFG will be used for electricity production.\n\nWenxi county landfill site (Hereafter referred as Wenxi county landfill site) is a sanitary landfill site, which started operation in May 2018 with a total design effective capacity of 900,000 m3 and an operational lifespan of 11 years. Now it received municipal solid waste of 250 tons/d. The proposed project activity has a total designed capacity 1.0MW (2*500kW) and combusts the LFG, which contains nearly 50% of methane, to generate electricity and export it to the North China Power Grid (NCPG). \n\nThe proposed project activity collects and utilizes LFG from Wenxi county landfill site for power generation, which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Methane in the LFG has been emitted to the atmosphere since the landfill started operation. Therefore, the proposed project activity avoids methane emissions and, at the same time, electricity is generated from a renewable energy source, instead of being provided by the grid.\n\nThe exported electricity is estimated to be 4,066 MWh a year on average. The estimated annual average emission reduction generated by the proposed project activity over the crediting period (the crediting period is 5 years) is 23,628 tCO2e per year by avoiding the CH4 emissions from the landfill and the CO2 emissions from the fossil fuel power plants in the NCPG.\n"},

Thus, over 4 cycles, in 12 years, the project aims to cover 6000 hectares with the help of 2000 local families in 100 villages. The project started reforestation activities in 2021 and will continue until 2033. 150 hectares were reforested in 2021 and 500 hectares are reforested every following year until 2033. The project applies assisted natural regeneration measures and natural reforestation methods that strengthen biodiversity and seeks to maximize the involvement of local populations to ensure the long-term sustainability of the reforested areas. Seeds of a mix of 40 local forest species are directly harvested around the villages, and are thus adapted to the area, to ensure sustainability. The seeds are directly collected from many local growers, so called ‘seed families’, to which the project provides an income that helps enhance their forest heritage and promote agroforestry practices. “Seed families” have a seed tree, from which 20,000 seeds are collected per year. The project disperses seeds on the land through direct sowing with the help of the local population. In addition, landowners wishing to revitalize their land may invite arboRise to reforest a few hectares, we call them ‘field families’, and there is no change in land ownership. ‘Field families’ each make 6 hectares available. The project sows 10,000 seeds per hectare, which is added to natural regeneration. The “field families” implement measures to ensure the protection and growth of those forests and harvest non-timber forest products (fruits, seeds, fodder, etc.) according to the principles of agroforestry. There is no commercial logging activity in this project, only targeted thinning and pruning may be done to promote the growth of trees with high sequestration potential."},

Notwithstanding significant progress, access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities remains challenging for humanity. \nWest Africa is among the regions with the lowest access to safe drinking water. By 2025, over sixty percent of West African countries will face water scarcity, and about eighty percent of surface water will witness eutrophication. The access to water and proper sanitation in these regions remain abysmal at less than 50 percent and 40 percent, respectively. \nSimilarly, the South Asian region also faces water scarcity and open defecation challenges. According to the UNICEF analysis, over 134 million people do not have access to safe drinking water, and about 86-84 percent of water sources in South Asia are contaminated. \nWater scarcity, water contamination, and open defecation have huge health, social, and ecological costs. Lack of access to safe drinking water results in people drinking untreated and potentially contaminated drinking water, resulting in diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea. Also, as women and young girls are primarily responsible for water collection in most households without drinking water on their premises, water collection takes away a significant portion of their time and hampers crucial activities such as going to school, caring for their health, and improving their skills.

Currently, households predominantly rely on solid biomass for cooking, primarily firewood, using rudimentary three stone cookstoves. This reliance leads to extensive time spent on firewood collection, deforestation, land degradation, and significant greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. Moreover, it poses serious health risks due to exposure to smoke and emissions.\n\nImplemented by Infinite Earth Private Limited, the project intends to distribute energy-efficient cookstoves with a thermal efficiency of 36.42%, utilizing natural draft technology. These stoves aim to enable households to cook the same amount of food with less firewood consumption, thereby mitigating environmental degradation and health hazards associated with traditional cooking methods.\n\nThe project targets distributing up to 15,000 energy-efficient stoves to replace inefficient biomass stoves in households. The distribution will be done at zero cost to the households, with revenue generated solely through emission reduction certificates. This revenue model aims to incentivize the uptake of efficient stoves while discouraging the use of baseline inefficient stoves.\n\nThe project's geographical boundary covers the Gairatganj block in Raisen District, Madhya Pradesh, India. Over the first crediting period, the project anticipates a total emission reduction of 250,598 tons of CO2, with an average annual reduction of 50,120 tons of CO2.\n\nIn summary, the project seeks to promote sustainable cooking practices by providing energy-efficient stoves to households in Raisen District, thereby reducing fuelwood consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and health risks associated with traditional cooking methods. It employs a revenue generation model through emission reduction certificates to facilitate widespread adoption of efficient stoves."},

In recent years this resource is becoming scarce and consequently the price increases: this is due to human pressure on resources caused by population growth and indiscriminate tree felling. This phenomenon worsens the living conditions of low-income families who depend entirely on charcoal as the only source of fuel to cook food. Another negative effect associated with the use of inefficient cookstoves is the constant exposure to smoke that causes or worsens respiratory, eye and skin diseases.\nCarbonsink plans to develop a project for the production and distribution of energy efficient stoves in the districts of Inhambane province. Project activities are scheduled to start in September 2022 and the project developer foresee to distribute a total of 20,000 efficient stoves initially in the districts of Massinga and Morrumbene and later to cover other districts of the province.\nThe project will distribute locally produced Mbaula A stoves composed of ceramic internal part and metallic (aluminium) outer skirt and base. These stoves will address the challenges pointed as they aid reducing the consumption of charcoal. \n"},

The company started production of food-grade rPET in 2012. Bariq facility is located in CPC Industrial Park on the 6th of October city, Giza. Bariq uses post-consumer PET bottles from Municipal Solid Waste that would otherwise go to landfill or burned. Bariq produces recycled pallets ready to be used in the injection-blowing industry for bottles. Bariq holds a positive EFSA opinion (see EFSA Certificates in the following LINK) and an FDA Letter of Non-Objection (LNO). Health Canada approval, REACH &amp; GRS compliant PET pellets. Bariq'I's facility is compliant with BRC and SEDEX. \nBariq decided to expand its capacities and increase its contribution to fighting climate change by installing a new recycling line \"recoSTAR PET ART\" first of its kind in the Middle East to increase its capacity from 15,000 tonnes to 33 tonnes annually (please see Attestation Letter from Starlinger in this LINK). This will be done in October 2023 and will operate its second recycling line Starlinger \"recoSTAR PET ART\", which will raise its production capacity to 33,000 tonnes. Bariq is currently recycling 1.6 billion PET bottles per year and a total of 15 billion PET bottles since its establishment which contributed to saving more than 260,000 tons of CO2.\nBales of PET bottles are received from collected & sorted municipal waste. The bales must only contain post-consumer PET bottles. Each batch received is checked to make sure that it doesn’t contain more than 5% PET bottles that are coming from non-food content (Detergents, cosmetics, etc.). The material is further sorted in an automated pre-sorting line to remove labels, caps, and other non-PET materials if present. The sorted material is then transferred to the cold washing stage to remove any remaining label, sand, or dirt attached to the bottle body. After that, the bottles are sorted by second automated machines to remove colored, non-PET bottles, metals, and any contaminants. \nThe sorted materials are then shredded into flakes which are transferred by pipe to a floating tank to remove labels and caps (poly olefine separation). These shredded flakes are hot-washed with water (90°C) and caustic soda. After drying the flakes, it transferred to another grinder equipped with sieving screens to remove the dust and homogenize the size of the flakes. These flakes are transferred to the 3rd automated sorting stage (2 machines) (optical sorter machine followed by polymer sorter machine) and finally, the shredded flakes are packed into big bags.\nThe flakes pre-processed through the mentioned method are then decontaminated using Starlinger technology. This consists of a pelletizing unit, an inline crystallizer, and a solid-state polycondensation unit (SSP). The CDU, EX, CRY, and SSP are the critical stages for the decontamination of the material. The critical parameters that are relevant for decontamination are temperature, residence time, and vacuum level at different stages of the process. (please see Line Description in the following LINK)\nEach production batch is tested as per Bariq’s Quality control procedures which define procedures for operation and troubleshooting. Quality checks are carried out as per the quality manual to ensure that the material has been produced meeting the specifications of the process for the entire batch. The rPET produced by the above-mentioned procedure is then packed into big bags of (1200) kg and labeled with the respective batch numbers and production date."},

The landfill started the operation in August 2013, receiving solid waste (type Class II-A Inert and Class II-B Non-inert) .\n\nThe project activity results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction from the CTR Rosario through two ways:\ni.\tBurning CH4 in flares and/or group generators;\nii.\tThe amount of electricity generated in the project activity is dispatched to the Brazilian national grid, avoiding the dispatch of an equal amount of energy produced by fossil-fuelled thermal plants to that grid. The initiative avoids CO2 emissions and contributes to the regional and national sustainable development.\n\nPrior to the implementation of the project activity, the scenario for (i) LFG destruction was the partial released to atmosphere through the exiting LFG passive capture system and partial and intermittent LFG combustion in gas wells. Regarding the (ii) electricity generation, the baseline scenario is the generation in existing and/or new grid-connected power plants.\n\nThe baseline scenario is the scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project activity.\n\nThe project activity aims to capture and to flare the LFG and to generate electricity through the implementation of a power generation plant using LFG. The generation installed capacity during the second crediting period is equal to 3.0 MW (3 x 1.0 MW).\nThe project constructed an efficient capture, collection and flaring system to burn CH4 (a greenhouse gas), and this reduced odours and adverse environmental impacts. Moreover, it installs generators that combusts the LFG to produce electricity, using part of the electricity for self-consumption and the other part is exported to the grid. The flares are kept in operation due to LFG excess, periods when electricity is not be produced or other operational considerations. The LFG power plant has 3.0 MW (3 x 1.0 MW) installed.\n\nThe LFG capture and collection systems and flaring station consists of a LFG pipeline grid and a flaring station, equipped with flares, centrifugal blowers, and all other supporting mechanical and electrical subsystems and appurtenances necessary to run the system. The power generation facility comprises of LFG engine generator sets of high-performance standards. The engine-generator sets are the primary equipment to combust the collected LFG once they are installed. A fraction of the collected LFG is diverted to flares, which is used to combust any gas in excess of the fuel demand for the engines, as well as a contingency backup.\n\nThe lifetime of the landfill is expected to be 25 years since the starting operation, according to technical study .

Each facility will have an installed power capacity of 6.043 MWp, a total of 12.086 MWp but the production of energy will be limited by the nominal power of the invertors equipment that is 5 MW. The goal of these facilities is to align with the government's plan to increase power generation in the country, in order to meet the growing demand and diversify the sources of power.\nThe solar photovoltaic facilities will provide a clean and renewable source of energy that will reduce the country's carbon footprint and contribute to global efforts to combat climate change. This project is an important step towards achieving sustainable development in Cape Verde, and will have positive impacts on the environment, economy, and society.\nThe project aims to replace the current anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG's) estimated to be approximately 13,998 tCO2e per annum. This will be achieved by displacing an average of 21,540 MWh/year of electricity that is currently being produced by thermal fossil fuel based power plants.\nIn addition to reducing GHG emissions and diversifying the sources of power, the project will also create job opportunities and boost the local economy. It will involve the installation of solar panels, inverters, transformers, and other necessary equipment, which will require local labor and contribute to the development of the renewable energy industry in the country.\nIn Cape Verde, solar energy currently represents only about 2% of all electric power plants in the country. Therefore, the creation of two new greenfields solar photovoltaic facilities is a crucial step towards increasing the share of renewable energy in Cape Verde's energy mix.\n"},

These refugees are divided across 12 camps in the Wadi Fira region that borders Sudan. Chad is highly dependent on biomass as an energy source. Natural resources such as water and firewood are increasingly rare, causing tension between host communities and refugees. As a result, refugees must travel increasingly large distances to collect firewood. This is a high-risk activity, as many women are subject to sexual and gender-based violence. The project aims to address this issue and meet basic domestic energy needs through the distribution of solar cookers in the refugee camps to reduce dependency on biomass for cooking. The project also aims to build local capacity for manufacturing and repairing solar cookers, raise awareness, hold cooking demonstrations, and provide training on proper use and maintenance to beneficiaries."},

With the local support of the partner Meensou India Private Limited (Meensou) , EcoAct SAS will coordinate the production and distribution of improved cookstoves across this project area. \nIn Odisha state, the traditional three-stone-fire stove is widely used by households for cooking, which creates numerous social and environmental problems, and has dramatic consequences on families in this area. Odisha is one of the poorest region of India, with and extreme poverty rate of 29%, compared to 10% for India, according to national statistics. The project will focus on the most rural areas of Odisha state, where wood is the main source of fuel used for cooking. The stove will be sold at a reduced price to make it available to the poorest communities. This project will actively contribute to various UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."},

Furthermore, it is stipulated that these plantations are to be certified under a Voluntary Carbon Market certification scheme with the intent of producing carbon credits while creating climate impact.\nThe farms in question have been subject to logging of commercially valuable species since the 1970s. Subsequently, during the colonization of East Panama (Cañitas-Tortí 1970's and 1980's), the lands have been deforested and gradually degraded by repetitive slash-and-burn processes and conversion to pasture.\nAt the time of reforestation, the vegetation cover of the farms includes wooded pastures with native and improved grasses, as well as areas of stubble mostly in their different stages of development between 1-5 years of age. The only economic activity has been extensive cattle ranching in pasture areas. \nFurthermore, the project aims to improve the livelihoods of local populations, in special regards to women head-of-family, by incrementing their participation in the activities. The tree nurseries, a central piece to the plantations, aims to hire only women under this description, providing also training in several areas to ensure a stable income and tangible professional progression. \nThe project is also committed to the conservation of endangered wildlife. There is evidence that the project area is transverse by wild fauna currently part of the IUCN Red List, collected by using trap cameras. The aim of the carbon certification is to create conditions to expand the program to monitor this wildlife as part of the conservation effort. The project may assume additional activities to improve the wildlife presence in the area."},

Currently, most cooking in Togo is done with firewood and charcoal using traditional stoves such as three-stone fires and Malgache stoves. These inefficient stoves have significant impacts on health, forest degradation, and emission of greenhouse gases.  This project aims to enable the production and distribution of 200,000 improved cookstoves within 5 years, beginning in autumn 2022. Firewood users will have access to Himalayan cookstoves (produced by local potters using clay and other materials provided by the households themselves) and charcoal users will have access to Asuto cookstoves (portable stoves made up of a ceramic core and metal envelope). Evidence shows that these improved stoves can reduce fuel consumption by around 30%  compared to traditional stoves. The project targets households and artisans in the Plateaux, Maritime, and Centrale regions of Togo, which comprises about two-thirds to Togo’s total population. The cookstoves distributed through this project intend to be subsidized at 50% of the full price and come with a 5-year guarantee on potential defects. In addition to the distribution of subsidized cookstoves, the project will also support the local production of the stoves by identifying and providing technical and marketing training to 100 local potters and 30 local welders, as well as implement education and awareness activities on environmental and other benefits of improved cookstoves.

The project provides access to clean drinking water for rural households and directly replaces non-renewable biomass (fuelwood) burning at baseline that would have been otherwise used to boil water at baseline which is mainly sourced from the unimproved or unhealthy water sources under the baseline scenario. In line with the Gold Standard definition, an improved drinking-water source is one that by the nature of its construction and design adequately protects the source from outside contamination, in particular by faecal matter. The underlying assumption is that improved sources are more likely to supply safe drinking-water than unimproved sources.\n\nIn this regard, borehole and tube wells are considered as the project scenario under ‘Improved Water Sources’. This falls under the category of “Eligible community water supply technologies (CWS)” and thus the project creates direct impacts into the basic need of the rural lives through piped water into dwellings sourced from tubewell and/or borehole. Under the project activity, new boreholes and tubewells are being constructed as new water supply points for the households. It is, therefore envisaged that the project will deliver a long-term and secured contribution to sustainable development in the host country by means of access to clean water, good health and reduction in GHG emissions due to avoidance of non-renewable biomass."},

This revolutionary concentrate, rich in copper and precious metals enjoys a low environmental footprint by bypassing the traditional mining channels and instead tapping into the ever-growing e-waste urban mine.\n \nIgneo has perfected a simple yet exceptionally effective recycling and recovery solution to transform and enhance the vast quantities of valuable e-waste that are currently left untreated, unrecycled, and often abandoned in landfill. The Igneo process employs a multi-stage model which fully captures the economic value held in e-waste:\n* Sourcing of electronic waste from traders, collectors and OEMs and identifying valuable key PCB (printed circuit board) and other metal containing material;\n* Crushing and shredding the e-waste into a normalized fraction for further processing and sampling;\n* The resulting shredded material is automatically sampled and then analyzed at on-site lab to determine the valuable metals contents;\n* Using automated mechanical separation technology, remove the iron and aluminum from the shredded fraction;\n* The shredded material is heat-treated using a pyrolyzing multi-hearth furnace, which convert organic matter into a gas state while retaining all metals. The result is a    homogeneous concentrate containing copper, silver, gold, palladium, platinum etc. (copper concentrate);\n* The off gas generated from the pyrolysis process is processed through several stages of gas remediation, including a post combustion chamber resulting in the mitigation or complete elimination of all toxic pollutants including dioxins, NOx gases and halogens.\n \nThe proprietary Igneo process converts and upgrades e-waste into a concentrate which is higher in valuable recoverable metal content than most other traditional copper concentrates and for the most part free of organic matter, sulfur, and toxic materials which are harmful or cost prohibitive to the copper smelting and refining processes. \n\nThe estimated emissions savings per year are 32,000tCO2e, which accounts for 160,000tCO2e of the first crediting period 2023 - 2027."},

The Clean Energy LLC has wind farm a capacity of 49.6 MW and generate (net) 168.5 GWh of electricity per year.\n\nOn 25th June 2013, The Salkhit wind farm started commercial operation. The Salkhit wind farm generates renewable electricity using wind power resources and sells the generated output to the Central Energy System (CES, or the grid) on the basis of a power purchase agreement (PPA). In addition, the Salkhit wind farm also aims to lead renewable energy generation from wind in Mongolia, as the Salkhit wind farm was the first grid connected wind farm in Mongolia. The Salkhit wind farm generates greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions by avoiding CO2 emissions from electricity generation by fossil fuel power plants that is supplied to Grid.\n\nThus, Salkhit wind farm installed capacity is 49.6 MW of renewable energy power generation and supplies to the Grid of 164 GWh of electricity generated from renewable energy annually.\n\nA. Project scenario is the operation of 31 sets of wind turbines with a total capacity of 50MW which will supply an annual generation of 164GWh to grid and replace same amount of electricity generated by fossil fuel-fired power plants connected to grid. According to ACM0002 applied, the project is renewable electricity activity.\nB. The baseline scenario of the project is the electricity supply of equal amount as the project from the grid. The baseline scenario of the project is the same as the scenario prior to the start of implementation of project activity.\n\nThe Project boundary included the project site and all power plants connected physically to the grid.\n\nAs the Grid is dominated by thermal power generation, the Salkhit wind farm activity is leading to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. The second crediting period for the proposed project is from 24/06/2020 to 23/06/2027 and estimated emission reduction is in the second crediting period are 1,332,835tCO2e. The average annual emission reduction is estimated by 190,405 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) for the 2nd crediting period.\n\nSustainable development\nAs the very first wind farm in Mongolia the Salkhit wind farm is greatly assisting the country in stimulating the commercialisation of grid-connected renewable energy technologies and markets. The Salkhit wind farm is helping to reduce GHG emissions versus the coal-dominated business-as-usual scenario. Furthermore, the Salkhit wind farm is improving air quality and local livelihoods and promote sustainable renewable energy industry development.\nThe specific goals of the project are to:\n• generate electricity;\n• help to stimulate the implementation of wind power in Mongolia;\n• reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Mongolia compared to a business-as-usual scenario;\n• create local employment opportunity during the assembly and installation of wind turbines, and for operation of the wind farm;\n• reduce other pollutants resulting from the power generation industry, compared to a business-as-usual approach, such as SO2 and soot."},

The project will last 5 years and will be renewable twice, for a maximum period of 15 years.\n\nThe project's cookstove model is a metal-ceramic fireplace using wood. \n\nThe benefits will be both environmental and social. On the social front, the project will create jobs, reduce smoke emissions including smoke inhalation diseases, and reduce the time spent cooking and collecting biomass because the project's cooking stove needs less biomass to function. From an environmental point of view, the project will reduce the impact on the forest by reducing wood collection and thus avoid carbon emissions.\n\nThe objective of this improved cookstove project is therefore to improve the health and well-being of households, mainly women and children in the project area, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions released by traditional cooking and water boiling activities. \nThe owner of the project is APEDD, a Guinean NGO (Association of Women for Development) that promotes women's empowerment and environmental protection.\nThe standard chosen for this project is the Gold Standard and the methodology applied is the TPDDTEC (Technologies and Practices for Moving Decentralized Thermal Energy Consumption) V3.1.\n"},

LPG is safer to transport and use and is precisely controllable by end-users – with known and consistent properties and minimal emissions of toxic byproducts. LPG does not emit soot (black carbon), smoke or dangerous fumes. The use of LPG stoves will be much more efficient than what is currently being used for cooking, thus requiring much fewer BTUs of fuel per meal. The result will be substantial reductions in both greenhouse gas and non-GHG pollution.\n\nPayGo’s approach will be to use a Cylinder Smart Meter (CSM) system that enables a “pay as you go” service. The CSM contains a low-pressure LPG regulator, metering capabilities and a communications system. The product affixes to existing cylinder valves and enables customers to make small payments for LPG via the customer’s mobile money account. To use PayGo’s CSM, a customer need only have mobile money."},

This will be achieved through the distribution and installation of ATEC PAYGO enabled eCook induction cookstoves. ATEC’s patented electric cookstove (eCook) is the world’s first Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) induction stove which is ATEC’s flagship product that brings 27 months ranged PAYGO facility, Global System for Mobile (GSM) Communications and Internet of Things (IoT) functionality that makes mobile money payments easy for unbanked and underserved populations. \nThe primary target are end-users who cook using polluting fuels in inefficient stoves in the baseline, yet are already connected to the grid. The use of electricity for cooking using highly efficient cooking appliances is expected to provide an affordable, convenient, and safe cooking solution to end-users. The program will also contribute towards sustainable development goals key among them being SDG 1,3,7 and 13. The first project activities are being implemented in Bangladesh and Cambodia.\nThe specific description of the Program of Activity is as follows:\na)\tThe Program of Activities (PoA) entails the distribution of an e-cooking solution among households especially those using biomass for cooking yet are connected to the grid. \nb)\tThe PoA is being developed and implemented by ATEC*, who will have the formal responsibility of coordinating the PoA and the included VPAs.\nc)\tATEC* will work with local project implementers who will provide support in the management of the VPAs in respective countries. \nd)\tThe PoA is a voluntary action by the project developer and will apply the Methodology for Metered & Measured Energy Cooking Devices in the calculation of emission reductions. \nThe project will have social, economic, and environmental benefits and impacts across the following multiple areas:\n•\tImproved health: Using e-cooking solutions reduces the use of polluting fuels such as firewood, charcoal, and kerosene which disproportionately impacts women and children due to smoke and other household in-door air polluters causing respiratory illnesses. E-cooking provides a clean, safe and reliable cooking solution that will lead to significant improvement in indoor air quality in beneficiary households (SDG 3).\n•\tEnvironment & Climate Change: using traditional inefficient biomass stoves consumes a lot of fuel and emits GHG emissions to the atmosphere. Using electricity for cooking will reduce CO2 and black carbon emissions hence reducing the impacts of climate change (SDG 13).\n•\tGender equality and empowerment of women: Cooking on traditional inefficient biomass stoves (firewood and charcoal) consumes a lot of fuel leading to the constant need to source the fuel. Consequently, fuel collection is usually done by women and girls, and this requires more time and effort which takes away their productive hours. The e-cooking technology being promoted by the project developer is efficient and saves on households’ time since there is no need for collecting wood, and the cooking time is shortened. This leads to productive use of time at home, especially for women who can venture into other income-generating activities and improve the quality of study time for children (SDG 4 & 5).\n•\tMoney and Time savings: Most families using biomass fuels and kerosene for cooking spend a significant portion of their time and income on fuel collection and purchase. As fuel becomes scarce, expenditure on fuel becomes more significant due to the increase in fuel prices and this leads to more household income being spent on meeting the household energy needs. ATEC seeks to target households who are connected to the grid but using biomass and kerosene for cooking, in the distribution of the units. Using the technology will provide meaningful time and money savings for these end-users (SDG 1).\n•\tAffordable and Clean Energy: Affordable clean energy for cooking is an essential form of energy access which will be achieved through the e-cooking technology being promoted by the program (SDG 7).\n•\tJob creation: The program will create employment opportunities for many people in different phases of the program. These are expected to benefit locals and especially the youths who will be employed as part of sales and service teams, and the overall management of the program (SDG 8).\n\n"},

Water seeps through advanced and efficient filtration system, removing bacteria and other suspended solids, and treated water is stored in the barrel, which is easily accessed by turning on the faucet. The water filtration system requires no energy input or consumables. With a capacity to purify 3.5 liters of water per hour and a 15-year lifespan of the water purifiers. It will offer an affordable, long-term and zero emission solution for households that generally consume unsafe drinking water. It will not only dramatically increase access to safe drinking water but also reduce consumption for woody fuels previously required to treat drinking water, which will decrease environmental degradation and greenhouse gas emissions."},

The OASIS Box is an all-in-one, solar-powered water filtration and storage unit, which offers up to 10,000 liters of 99.9999% contamination free water daily. See section A.3 for detailed breakdown of technology. Each OASIS Box will bring clean water to 100 households. Based on the average no. of people per household at 5, overall, this project has the capacity to bring clean water to up to 75,000 individuals in Nowshera. The project will be implemented in phases beginning with Phase 1: 10 OASIS Box deployments.  \nHouseholds in rural communities have limited resource to purify water, often resulting in consumption of dirty water. By and large, these communities often find themselves in a cycle of chronic illness which particularly impacts children and often leads to fatalities. In Pakistan alone, an estimated 53,000 children die annually from water-borne related disease (UNICEF). In addition, Pakistan still has strides to make in implementing green technology in the WASH sector. In the absence of national action, communities are extremely self-reliant and rely on conventional methods such as burning fuelwood to purify water. In the baseline scenario (per 100 households) an estimated following VERs are emitted from burning fuelwoods to purify water:  \n330 ton CO2, 17.5 ton CH4 and 17.5 ton N2O\nBy deploying our units as a safe and sustainable alternative, project emissions are assumed to be zero given that our technology only utilizes solar energy, without access to a backup generator or connection to an electrical grid. In the project scenario, each unit is estimated to offset 360 VERs. \n"},

The Boja stoves will replace low-efficiency three- stone cookers and other traditional stoves popularly used in Ghana. The advanced design of the improved cookstoves allows quicker heating-up, less fuel use, high heat retention and lower quantities of combustion fumes. The use of the Boja stoves will result in the following benefits:\n\tSignificant savings of charcoal and wood fuel costs\n\tReduced indoor air pollution (IAP)\n\tGreenhouse gas emission reduction.\n\nThe project will be coordinated and implemented by CookClean Ghana Limited and will target the whole country of Ghana, starting with densely populated urban areas where charcoal consumption is high. The project will then expand to the wider peri-urban and rural areas where the utilization of wood fuel is high.\n\nThe project will disseminate, but not limited to, the BOJA improved stove which has been designed and manufactured by CookClean Ghana Limited.\n\nThe boundary covered by the large-scale project is the geographical boundary of Ghana.\n\nThe Boja stoves will displace baseline inefficient cooking devices that consume more non-renewable biomass. From the applied methodology (Technologies and Practices to Displace Decentralized Thermal Energy Consumption, Version 4.0), the baseline scenario is the consumption of non-renewable biomass using inefficient devices for thermal energy needs as those provided by the project devices.\n"},

Further, indoor air pollution through health-damaging pollutants while combusting firewood and charcoal result in diseases like e.g. pneumonia, stroke, ischaemic heart diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and lung cancer. The project activity will relieve these negative impacts."},

The Project is a Non-Conventional Renewable Energy (NCRE) generation plant that will be developed in Ras Ghareb on the Gulf of Suez, Egypt, by an Independent Power Producer (IPP). The project is an alternative to dispatching existing and developing new, fossil fuel based and greenhouse gas (GHG) intensive, power generation plants connected to the electricity grid (the baseline situation). The substitution of the generation of more GHG intensive electricity will lead to GHG emission reductions that will be monitored during the lifetime of the project activity.\n\n\nThis project activity is a voluntary initiative of the project participants and Ras Ghareb Wind Energy SAE (RGWE) as the Project Developer. The relation between the Project Participants is based on a tender for the right to build, own and operate the project based on a Power Purchase Agreement with EETC. Ras Ghareb Wind Energy SAE, which is a consortium of ENGIE (France), Toyota Tsusho – Eurus (Japan) and Orascom Construction (Egypt), submitted a successful proposal and was awarded with the right to develop the project. The RGWE project will be connected to Egypt’s national grid and all its energy will be sold to EETC based on the tariff established by the auction process. The project achieved financial close on 14 December 2017, which is the date where construction agreements were enacted, and is expected to reach full commercial operations around 24 months later.\n\n\nThe project boundary includes the project power plant and each of its power units and all power plants/units physically connected to the same electricity grid that the power plant is connected to. The RGWE project is aligned with Egypt’s governmental policies to increase NCRE generation to 30% of total energy demand by 2035. To pursue this objective and the resulting GHG mitigation, Egypt has enacted diverse incentives and promotional policies and is planning to establish a national, or even regional, carbon market to attract foreign direct investment."},

An exporter of rice before 1980, Nepal now imports huge quantities of milled rice every year, draining fiscal resources and adversely impacting development efforts. The situation may aggravate in the coming decades in the face of population growth, scarcity of land, labor and water, and ill effects of climate change. The Agricultural Development Strategy (2015-2035) of Nepal outlines the crucial role of rice in ensuring food security, improving income and rural livelihoods and ultimately, reducing poverty in the country. In addition to being the most important crop, rice cultivation is also one of the most important contributors of the methane emission led by the cultivation practice.

The specific description of the project activity is as follows:\r\na)\tThe project entails distribution and installation of Pay as You Go LPG units that are made distinct by the unique smart meter developed by Circle Gas.\r\nb)\tThe project developer is Circle Gas, who will have the formal responsibility of the Project activity.\r\nc)\tThe VPA implementor for this project activity is M-Gas Kenya, and will be directly responsible for maintaining the sales database, collecting baseline information, and co-ordinating the annual monitoring process. \r\nd)\tThe project activity is a voluntary action by the project developer. \r\ne)\tThe goal of the project is to accelerate access to LPG especially among low-income households which will significantly reduce GHG emissions, and other negative effects associated with use of traditionally unsustainable fuels such as wood, charcoal, and kerosene.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project activity is to replace traditional biomass (fuelwood and charcoal), and kerosene cookstoves used in the baseline, with LPG units which will deliver impacts across the following multiple areas:\r\n•\tImproved health: Using LPG reduces the use of dirty fuels such as firewood, charcoal and kerosene which disproportionately impacts on women and children due to smoke and other household air polluters causing respiratory illnesses. Household Air Pollution (HAP) is one of the largest health risk factors for mortality in Kenya with about 21,560 deaths attributed to HAP annually . Clean burning liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), although a fossil fuel, emits low levels of BC and minimal PM2.5 concentrations, typically meeting WHO Indoor Air Quality Guideline levels for health (SDG 3).  \r\n•\tEnvironment & Climate Change: using traditional inefficient biomass and kerosene stoves consumes more fuel and emits GHG emissions to the atmosphere. Clean burning liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), although a fossil fuel, emits low levels of black carbon and minimal PM2.5 concentrations, typically meeting WHO Indoor Air Quality Guideline levels for health.Using LPG reduces CO2 and black carbon emissions hence reducing the impacts of climate change (SDG 13).\r\n•\tGender equality and empowerment of women: Cooking on traditional biomass inefficient stoves (firewood and charcoal) consumes a lot of fuel leading to constant need to source the fuel. Consequently, fuel collection is usually done by women and girls, and this requires more time and effort which takes away their productive hours. The project technology is efficient and saves on households’ time since there is no need for collecting wood and cooking time is shortened. This leads to improved use of time at home especially for women who can venture in other income generating activities and give children more time for study (SDG 4 & 5).\r\n•\tMoney and Time savings: Families spend a significant portion of their time and income on fuel collection and purchase. As fuel becomes scarce, expenditure on fuel becomes more significant due to the increase in fuel prices and this leads to more household income being spent on meeting the household energy provision. The Circle Gas target market is the urban low-income population. Using the technology provides meaningful savings for customers while creating thousands of high-quality jobs (SDG 1).\r\n•\tAffordable and Clean Energy: Affordable energy for cooking is an essential form of energy access which will be achieved through implementation of this programme (SDG 7).\r\n•\tJob creation: the project will create employment to many people especially the youths who will be employed as field sales and service teams, and the overall management of the programme (SDG 8). \r\n\r\nThe project boundary for the VPA is the Republic of Kenya. \r\nThe legal ownership of the products generated belongs to Circle Gas. The end-users sign a carbon rights waiver form, at the time of installation of the Circle Gas LPG unit, which transfers the carbon rights to Circle Gas. "},

ICS may comprise different technologies, including single burners and dual burners with and without chimney. All the deployed cookstoves will have an energy efficiency of more than 20%. \r\nIn the baseline scenario, the target households are dependent on traditional wood stoves for cooking. The use of firewood for daily cooking is not only one of the causes of deforestation but also indoor air pollution affecting directly or indirectly the health the women and children. There is also a marginal use of LPG in some households, due to the subsidy offered by the Indian government which does enable access to LPG but not continued usage. A detailed survey was conducted in the phase I of BACHAT project, which reflects that most of the households were primarily dependent on firewood and using traditional three stone or in efficient cooking technology. \r\n"},

A large part of the PoA boundary population cannot use modern fuels such as electricity or cooking gas on account of access, affordability and availability.  \r\nInefficient cooking devices consume significant amounts of fuel and emit dangerous smoke on account of their incomplete and inefficient combustion. The smoke emitted by traditional stoves is known to be one of the biggest health risks faced by women and children due to the presence of particulates.\r\nFor this reason, this proposed PoA aims at reducing the wood fuel consumption of inefficient cooking devices by distributing improved cook devices which reduce fuel consumption. To reduce deforestation and the emission of greenhouse gas within the PoA boundary, cooking devices being distributed will lead to use of less wood fuel or substitute it.\r\nThe PoA proposes to develop and commercialise the carbon assets from the distribution of various cooking devices (improved cook stoves, ethanol stoves, electric cookers, metered LPG, solar cookers amongst others) to replace baseline inefficient stoves.  The PoA will structured in away such that it can leverage on investor funding and carbon finance to support (subsidy) production and distribution.

Now, Fair Climate Fund (FCF), a Dutch organization based in Utrecht, The Netherlands in an agreement with tiipaalga association along with local communities/federation is developing 5 grouped VPAs (Voluntary Project Activities) that will cover the municipalities of Pô, Tiébélé and Gniaro in the Province of Nahouri and will seek inclusion under the registered gold standard PoA and later certify under Fairtrade Climate Standard. This VPA, being part of the 5 grouped VPAs, will be developed to implement clean, safe and energy efficient cooking stoves which will consume less firewood and reduce smoke in the cooking area. The project promotes the implementation improved cook stove which is a mud made 3 stones efficient woodstove “F3PA”. The improved cook stoves will replace traditional cooking stoves, which utilize firewood and charcoal. With this approach, the 5 VPAs will reach out to more than 10,000 households in the Province of Nahouri in Burkina Faso. This project seeks to increase access of rural communities to improved cook stoves by implementing F3PA mud stoves and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Burkina Faso. The improved cook stoves or F3PA mud stoves will be made of a mixture of clay mud, straw, dung of a donkey or cow and water. The stove will be constructed by locally available, inexpensive materials and its size will be customized as per the size of corresponding family. The project implementation will be done by imparting training to the local women in the rural areas. The technical and operational skill will be developed at local level which provides knowledge at household level on how to use and maintain the improved cook stoves. The implementation also includes component of education on hygienic usage and on the threat of climate change and health hazards related to the old cooking system and inform on the health and environmental benefits of using such efficient cook stoves. The proposed improved cook stove technology will create a positive impact on the environment and eligible for generating Gold Standard certified emission reduction units which will be later certified under Fairtrade Climate Standard. The revenue for the sale of certified credits including the premium for end users will be used for project implementation and climate change interventions among the rural communities."},

The purpose of the project is to replace the commonly used inefficient wood fired mud stoves technology, with clean, sustainable and efficient biogas. Each household utilizes cow dung to feed the digester for the production of biogas for cooking purpose and heating water. This leads to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by displacing conventionally used non renewable biomass with renewable biogas. In addition, the hygienic conditions in the rural areas will be improved by an appropriate disposal of waste. Further, residue from the bio digesters can be used as organic fertilizer and will improve soil conditions in rural areas.

Due to the higher thermal efficiency of the ICS relative to the traditional/baseline stoves, the ICS reduce the amount of non-renewable biomass fuel required for meeting similar thermal energy needs. \r\nIn the absence of the proposed PoA, inefficient traditional / 3-stone fires /charcoal pots would have been used for cooking.

The Program addresses two drivers for inhouse pollution and greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuel-based lamp devices with solar energy technology as well as inefficient stoves with more energy efficient cook stoves. These will be distributed to households and small holders in the project region, thereby helping to reduce fuel costs and risks for diseases in the respiratory systems and the eyes. Further tens of millions of schoolchildren in Africa cannot study after dark because they live without electricity. After school, children often help their families with household chores and agricultural tasks and once they turn their attention to homework, their neighbourhoods and villages are in almost complete darkness. By the distribution of solar lamps to school children this program will contribute to expanding study hours to night-time and reduces costs of unhealthy sources of light. As the project targets the improvement of livelihood in households this project targets as well the traditional cooking methods which are often inefficient, dangerous, and harmful to the environment. The Programme aims at providing especially women with improved stoves that improve health, safe time, firewood, and money. The stoves aim at reducing 50% of the timber used so less time is spent in gathering firewood, a task traditionally carried out by children and women that takes up to 20 hours a week. The new stove also emits less smoke and will result in less eye and respiratory diseases It is the aim of the program to support local developers of clean cook stoves in order to support their development and support technology that is reflecting the needs and was approved by local communities. The project scope is including, but not limited to the distribution of solar lamps for school kids, household solar PV applications, solar water pumps, and clean cookstove technologies. "},

This is achieved through the installation and operation of solar PV systems replacing fossil fuel-powered equipment.\r\nAgriculture is one of the most important sectors of the Moroccan economy. In many areas, precipitation levels are low, meaning that agricultural activity can only be sustained through irrigation. Inefficient pumping and irrigation systems have contributed to the decline of groundwater levels in Morocco, threatening soil fertility. Farmers without access to grid electricity usually power their pumping systems with diesel and butane gas, which they often source over long distances. Furthermore, they are dependant on fossil fuel prices.\r\nThis project allows farmers to become independant of fossil fuels through the hire purchase of a PV system, which they pay off over a period of 6 years. This does not create extra costs for farmers but instead saves them money, as they no longer need to purchase fuel. In order to obtain a PV system through this project, farmers are required to switch to a water-efficient drip irrigation system. Beyond reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the project thus helps to promote resource-efficient and sustainable agriculture."},

The use of non-renewable woody biomass contributes to deforestation and emits a lot of toxic smoke. Gas represents an alternative energy to the use of woody biomass for the cooking needs of households and street food vendors. Promoting the use of this energy therefore makes it possible to transfer household energy demand to another fuel, thus easing the pressure on the vegetation cover. In addition, gas cooking significantly reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) and fine particle emissions, thus contributing to the fight against climate change. Gas cooking also has a health impact, as it considerably reduces the inhalation of harmful fumes by users, while providing incomparable cooking comfort. Mivo Energie aims to remove these barriers to adoption of this clean and economical cooking method by developing networks for the distribution of quality equipment and gas refills, and by setting up innovative financial services to facilitate access for vulnerable households."},

The project is located at Jaisalmer district in the state of Rajasthan. The project will generate energy through renewable source i.e. wind. The kinetic energy of wind is converted into mechanical energy and subsequently into electrical energy. Kinetic energy which is carried by wind when passes through the blades of the WTG, is converted to mechanical energy which rotates the connected generator and which in turn produces the electricity. The electricity thus produced will be displacing the grid electricity which would have been otherwise generated through sources dominated by fossil fuel based power plants. The project activity thereby reduces the emission of green house gases which would have been generated from such fossil fuel based power plants. The electricity generation from the project activity will contribute to GHG reductions estimated at 11,568 t CO2e annually, while 115,680 t CO2e over period of 10 years. "},

The PoA is a voluntary action with a goal of providing solutions that will reduce GHG emissions, and other negative effects associated with the use of non-renewable fuel from cooking at household levels. The use of non-renewable fuel such as wood and charcoal for cooking, leads to the emission of greenhouses gases, deforestation, and poor indoor climate. The programme will use several different technologies to reach this goal.  The solutions are based on two concepts that fall under the same CDM methodology: \t \r\n1.\tReduce the need for boiling water for drinking and thus reduce the need for non-renewable fuel for boiling water. This is achieved by providing clean and safe drinking water to participating households. The purified water is provided either through\r\na.\tWater purification system provided at the household level or b.\tCommunity-based water purification system where the households will get the purified water at water stations.  \r\n 2. Provide clean renewable fuel for cooking and thus eliminate the need for non-renewable fuel consumption for cooking. This is done by providing highly efficient stoves that are using renewable fuel. The renewable fuel can either be:  \r\nc.\tDenatured alcohol or \r\nd.\tBiogas.  \r\nHowever, for this project, the specific focus is on the provision of clean renewable fuel for cooking and this will entail the distribution of denatured alcohol (ethanol) stoves in Kenya. \r\nThe project has been registered with the UNFCCC, the reference number 7359.  The POA covers 19 African countries but for this Sub-POA, the host country is Kenya. The Sub-POA is comprised of 3 CPAs (CPAs 0027,0034 and 0047).

Building on a track record of implementing wind energy projects in Europe and the United States, UPC has ongoing wind project development activities in Europe, North Africa, China, and the Philippines .The proposed project is to be located in the Tangier-Tetouan Region, Fahs Anjra Province, Morocco. 40 wind turbines with a nominal unit capacity of 3 MW will be installed, providing a total capacity of 120 MW. The net expected electricity generation is estimated at 296,100 MWh/year . The Load Factor (Net Capacity Factor) is 28.17% or 2467.69 full load hours annually. The wind farm production will be wheeled through the national electricity grid, for the use of UPC Renewables’ clients .The proposed project is developed in the context of the new regulatory framework in Morocco (the Law 13.09). This new Law 13.09 was adopted in Morocco in March 2010 to promote large scale renewable electricity generation projects offering the possibility for private operators to produce electricity from renewable resources and to sell the generated electricity to a pool of clients.The baseline scenario is the supply of equivalent annual power output by the national electricity grid. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the project activity.The electrical energy produced by the project activity will substitute electricity currently supplied by the national grid managed by the public utility, Office National de l’Electricité et de l’Eau Potable (ONEE ), and thus result in the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, mainly CO2, associated with the fossil fuel dominated power plants feeding the national grid.Using a new and renewable local source of energy, the proposed project will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions, the decrease of the country’s energy dependence vis-à-vis the importation of fossil fuels and will directly and indirectly help create new jobs. As such, the project activity is expected to contribute to the development of wind energy in Morocco and hence to help achieve the objectives of Morocco’s national strategy for renewable energy development. Generally speaking, the project’s contribution to Morocco’s sustainable development can be summarized by the following benefits:•Diversification of the national supply of energy;•Project in line with the Moroccan government’s objectives to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. The diversification of energy sources for electricity production is one of the objectives of the new Moroccan energy strategy with an objective of 20% of renewable energy capacity in the nation’s electricity production in 2012 and a targeted development of 2,000 MW of installed wind capacity by 2020 .•Local development of renewable energy usage;•Reduction of the country’s imports in hard currency by the use of wind power instead of electricity mainly currently produced from imported coal, oil products and natural gas;•Reduction of national GHG emissions in accordance with the objectives of the UNFCCC ;•Contribution to the development of national and foreign investments in the energy sector;•Clean technology transfer and local capacity building in wind electricity generation and optimal use of wind energy in a heavy industry ;•Increases local employment opportunities during the construction phase and subsequently for the project’s operation phase.

The baseline scenario was identified using data from a large scale national survey published by the  United Nations Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (UN-CEPAL), report titled Consumo de Leña en Honduras (April 2011).  This report shows that on average 69% of interviewed households used firewood as input for cooking food, and over 60% of baseline stove models are traditional designs that use woodfuel.  This SSC-CPA aims to provide both climate and livelihood benefits to the large population of Honduran households currently using inefficient biomass burning stoves.Several greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, are produced as a result of the combustion of non-renewable biomass as used in cooking stoves.  ICS improve heat transfer efficiency as compared to the baseline conventional stoves, thereby reducing both the amount of wood fuel used by unit appliance implemented and the emission of GHGs.  In addition to direct climate benefits, this SSC-CPA achieves several co-benefits that contribute to sustainable development:Environmental BenefitsThe project reduces the demand for biomass required for cooking stoves thus reducing the rate of deforestation connected to wood consumption. In addition, the reduction in use of less efficient stoves will yield a reduction in emissions from fuel combustion thus improving air quality and reducing the emission of harmful gases that contribute to climate change.Social and economic benefitsProject beneficiaries using the ICS reduce their wood consumption. The reduction in fuel needs will also save project beneficiaries time and income. This means that biomass users who gather wood will see a reduction in the amount that they have to collect, leaving that time available for other activities. Biomass users that purchase their fuel will be able to direct more of their income to other needs.  From the economic perspective, the project will contribute to the scale-up of local businesses and organizations, with the potential to create jobs in retail, marketing and distribution."},

The applied technology is a ceramic water filter that produces water of safe drinking water quality which is further described in section A.5 below.Prior to the implementation of the proposed project, in the proposed project boundary there is limited access to clean drinking water. Lack of ready access to a water source also limit the quantity of suitable drinking water that is available to a household. Even if the water is obtained from an improved source, water that must be fetched from a source that is not readily accessible to the household and may be contaminated during transport or storage . Nationally, boiling water prior to drinking is the most common treatment method (70.1 percent of total population). The percentage of urban people and rural people boiling water is 60.0 percent and 80.1 percent, respectively . The baseline scenario is the continuation of current practice, thus identical to the existing scenario prior to the implementation of the proposed project.Under the project scenario, the proposed project will reduce GHG emissions by replacing the use of non-renewable biomass or fossil fuel to boil water to purify the water for drinking purposes. This purification method is energy intensive, creates indoor air pollution that is damaging to health, and emits significant GHG. Thus, the project activity contributes to the reduction in the GHG gas emissions associated to fossil fuel combustion for obtaining safe drinking water (SDW) as per conventional methods of water purification and also provides access to SDW to the consumers at an affordable price. The project activity will result in an annual average CO2 emission reduction of 37,277 tCO2e and 372,774 tCO2e over a 10 year crediting period.

The project consists of the repair of damaged and defunct boreholes or wells. Boreholes/wells may be dysfunctional e.g. due to a broken or removed pump or other broken parts like plunger, chain or rising main. The rehabilitation of those boreholes/wells reduces the need for households to boil water as a means of purification. New boreholes might be drilled in case that this would reveal to be more favourable than rehabilitating boreholes/wells. \r\nMany existing boreholes in the districts of Rusizi, Ngoma, Rwamagana and Bugesera have fallen into disrepair because of lack of systematic maintenance programmes and due to insufficient financial means in the districts. The project aims to repair and maintain around 50 boreholes/wells  across the 4 districts. Any borehole/pump technology can be involved in the project activity. However, it is foreseen that the most common technologies will be of Afridev or India Mark. \r\nThe rehabilitated boreholes/wells will be properly maintained in form of both preventive and corrective maintenance and water coming from the water points will be periodically tested for E.coli bacteria in order to guarantee safe and clean water over the time. \r\nIt is planned to establish a WASH committee for each borehole. These committees amongst others help to ensure that surroundings of the boreholes/wells are kept clean and protected against animals or vandalism and notify the hand-pump mechanic immediately in case any problem with the borehole/well occurs."},

The ICSEA PoA does not buy or trade the carbon credits, but is an Africa-based carbon access facility for a very wide range of cook stove actors.ICSEA is open-access, meaning that many different stove suppliers, and many different models of stoves, can be included, using either firewood or charcoal as fuel, or renewable biomass. It is also being operated on a fair-trade basis, whereby the stove Supplier Organisations are required to state how the creators of the emission reductions (the women using the improved stoves) can receive significant benefits from the sale of these credits in the form of more affordable stoves, an annual stove maintenance service and a fair portion of the carbon income.

The purpose of the project is to replace the commonly used inefficient wood fired mud stoves technology, with clean, sustainable and efficient biogas. Each household utilizes cow dung to feed the digester for the production of biogas for cooking purpose and heating water.  This leads to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by displacing conventionally used non renewable biomass with renewable biogas. In addition, the hygienic conditions in the rural areas will be improved by an appropriate disposal of waste. Further, residue from the bio digesters can be used as organic fertilizer and will improve soil conditions in rural areas.

These are areas with a large rural population mainly using wood-energy with traditional three stones cookstoves.More than 3,500 households will have the Wanrou efficient cookstoves, since this type of efficient cookstove has not encountered any socio-cultural adoption barriers in previous experiments in 58 villages in the department of Atacora. About 300 rural women will be trained and equipped as instructors for the construction of the Wanrou efficient cookstove in their villages and surroundings.The Wanrou efficient cookstoves represent an accessible solution to improve the energy efficiency of cooking and limit the overconsumption of wood-energy, and will gradually replace the traditional three stones cookstoves. By reducing the consumption of non-renewable biomass, the Wanrou efficient cookstoves will also contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions while preserving forests, ecosystems and biodiversity. These efficient cookstoves are a solution currently deployed in the region by Eco-Benin to combat energy poverty and use the potential for the generation of carbon credits. The use of the Wanrou efficient cookstoves with smoke exhaust chimneys also reduces the number of cases of respiratory diseases, reduces the time spent by women and children to collect firewood, and creates local jobs through the construction of the Wanrou efficient coosktoves. In addition to the promotion of the Wanrou stoves the project will deploy at least 8 solar kiosks and foresee 100 Wanrou cookstoves with a thermal electric generator which will allow to charge a mobile phone and/or LED lamp.

The proposed project is located in the Southern Power Region and has been conceived for harnessing the power potential of left flank of the branch anicut in the Godavari River in Khammam District. This project involves the installation of six Horizontal Pit type full Kaplan turbines & generating units of 4 MW each to generate 24MW of power utilizing a rated head of 4.8m and a design discharge of 601.02m3 (Please refer to section A.4.3 for further technical details). \r\nThe project activity is a Greenfield project planned on the Godavari River. Thus, the scenario existing prior to the implementation of this project activity would be to allow the potential energy in the flowing river to go untapped. In the absence of the project activity, any existing power demand in the region would be met by the continued operation of fossil fuel based power plants in the grid. Hydropower is a clean, renewable source of energy and does not contribute to air or water pollution or the emissions of greenhouse gases. The water after powering the turbines will be discharged back into the Godavari River through a tailrace canal, located within the river course close to the left bank open channel. \r\nThe objective of the proposed project is to generate power from harnessing the water to meet the ever increasing demand for electricity in the Southern region of India. The generated power will be exported to the Southern regional grid via the sub-station at Bhadrachalam. The project is expected to export 100,300 MWh of energy per year to the grid. However, the project is commissioned and it is found that the generation in a year reached high is about 45801 MWh owing to various reasons. Hydro power plants are considered to be zero emission power sources. The project activity will displace the fossil fuel fired power generation from the grid and hence contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gases.\r\n The baseline scenario relates to the export of electricity to the grid by the operation of grid connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of the implementation of the project activity"},

The project aims to improve upon the traditional cooking methods used at more than 500 institutions, benefiting upwards of half a million individuals, reducing approximately 50,000  tons of CO2 emissions per annum, and approximately 325,000 tons of CO2 emissions over the course of the 7-year crediting period.The IICS may be of different models and/or different sizes and will consume firewood. The different models and/or different sizes of IICS are either manufactured by the local stove manufacturer and project participant (PP) Virunga Engineering Works (u) Limited (VEW) or purchased from other manufacturers. As schools and institutions move up in the energy ladder, and fuel briquettes made of agricultural residues become available in Uganda, these IICS could also be used with such fuel briquettes in the future. In the case that a school/institution/IICS will use briquettes made of renewable biomass (agricultural residues and/or firewood from renewable plantations), the PP will ensure that no emission reduction credits will be claimed from the fuel switch from non-renewable to renewable biomass but only from the fuel savings resulting from the introduction of the IICS. The IICS are both portable as well as fixed built-in types, serving schools and other institutional users like prisons, plantation estates and hospitals. These IICS are more efficient in transferring heat to the saucepans, and as such, IICS require less biomass fuel to perform an equivalent cooking task when compared to the baseline technology. This increase in efficiency  translates directly to the  large scale fuel savings over the traditional stoves currently in use. By reducing fuel consumption, the project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions from the use of biomass fuels. This reduction in fuel consumption is estimated and corresponding CO2 emission reductions are calculated from these savings. The project activity shall initially deploy the VEW rocket stove IICS of 300 liters saucepan capacity to schools and institutions, but may distribute other saucepan capacities and/or models of IICS that meet the minimum thermal efficiency requirement of 20% later on. The different IICS sizes are conditioned by the saucepan capacity and range from 30 liters and up to 450 liters."},

Building on a track record of implementing wind energy projects in Europe and the United States, UPC has ongoing wind project development activities in Europe, North Africa, China, and the Philippines .The proposed project is to be located in the Tangier-Tetouan Region, Fahs Anjra Province, Morocco. 40 wind turbines with a nominal unit capacity of 3 MW will be installed, providing a total capacity of 120 MW. The net expected electricity generation is estimated at 296,100 MWh/year . The Load Factor (Net Capacity Factor) is 28.17% or 2467.69 full load hours annually. The wind farm production will be wheeled through the national electricity grid, for the use of UPC Renewables’ clients .The proposed project is developed in the context of the new regulatory framework in Morocco (the Law 13.09). This new Law 13.09 was adopted in Morocco in March 2010 to promote large scale renewable electricity generation projects offering the possibility for private operators to produce electricity from renewable resources and to sell the generated electricity to a pool of clients.The baseline scenario is the supply of equivalent annual power output by the national electricity grid. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the project activity.The electrical energy produced by the project activity will substitute electricity currently supplied by the national grid managed by the public utility, Office National de l’Electricité et de l’Eau Potable (ONEE ), and thus result in the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, mainly CO2, associated with the fossil fuel dominated power plants feeding the national grid.Using a new and renewable local source of energy, the proposed project will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions, the decrease of the country’s energy dependence vis-à-vis the importation of fossil fuels and will directly and indirectly help create new jobs. As such, the project activity is expected to contribute to the development of wind energy in Morocco and hence to help achieve the objectives of Morocco’s national strategy for renewable energy development. Generally speaking, the project’s contribution to Morocco’s sustainable development can be summarized by the following benefits:•Diversification of the national supply of energy;•Project in line with the Moroccan government’s objectives to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. The diversification of energy sources for electricity production is one of the objectives of the new Moroccan energy strategy with an objective of 20% of renewable energy capacity in the nation’s electricity production in 2012 and a targeted development of 2,000 MW of installed wind capacity by 2020 .•Local development of renewable energy usage;•Reduction of the country’s imports in hard currency by the use of wind power instead of electricity mainly currently produced from imported coal, oil products and natural gas;•Reduction of national GHG emissions in accordance with the objectives of the UNFCCC ;•Contribution to the development of national and foreign investments in the energy sector;•Clean technology transfer and local capacity building in wind electricity generation and optimal use of wind energy in a heavy industry ;•Increases local employment opportunities during the construction phase and subsequently for the project’s operation phase. Estimated project start date: February 2018"},

It’s been a 10-year journey for Impact Carbon and its stove manufacturer partners, from bilateral support for pilot projects, to project scale-up with key partnership, to project maturity and independence – all which have helped create a thriving improved cookstove market in Uganda. Carbon revenues fund 100% of the Program and are used to support Impact Carbon’s manufacturer partners to grow their businesses. Capital investments have been provided for tools and machinery that streamline production and increase the efficiency of the stoves. These investments have been coupled with best-practice guidelines and hands-on technical assistance, which ensure they can meet demand without compromising quality or efficiency. Moreover, the project is now prioritizing demand for improved cookstoves by deploying large-scale radio mass media campaigns to deliver simple and clear messaging around the benefits of purchasing and owning an improved cookstove, mainly around reduced cooking times, lower charcoal usage and significant cost savings (as much as 50% less charcoal needed which can result in over USD$110 of savings per year). Thanks to this project, a nascent market with a handful of manufacturers is evolving into a commercially-sustainable market.For more information on this project, please visit ImpactCarbon.org"},

As a result we planned to make use of the Clean Development Mechanism Gold Standard (GS) certification and project in order to promote improved cook stoves (SAVE 80), in the area of operation of SMARTD, i.e. in the entire district of Qacha’s Nek and in the rural areas of Quthing and Mohale’s Hoek which are Seforong in the Quthing district, Hloahloeng, Sebaretlane, Qabanyane and Qabane in the Mohale’s Hoek district. The improved cook stove can be used by households, which are using mainly fuel wood as their source of fuel. The SAVE 80, stove set promoted by SMARTD contains a stainless steel stove, three cooking pots with lids and a heat retaining container/wonder cooker. This stove uses only small brittle sticks/twigs of wood to cook or boil water. It saves up to 80% of fuel wood compared to ordinary open fire way of cooking. This means that if you would need 1.5kg of wood to boil 6litres of water on an open fire, with SAVE 80 you would only need 0.3kg.The stove is suitable for cooking, frying and water heating. After reaching boiling point, food can be transferred to the wonder cooker where it will continue to simmer until it is well cooked. This further reduces wood consumption. Besides preventing greenhouse gas emissions, the objectives of the planned CDM Gold Standard programs are:•To reduce wood consumption to a sustainable level so as to allow natural recovery of forests and/or reforestation to take place.•To reduce soil erosion and protect the environment.•To reduce indoor air pollution wood smoke and avoid its harmful health consequences.•To reduce time for wood collection for households.•To contribute to the prevention of wood resources so as to avoid inter-communal conflicts over resources.•To empower participating women groups in villages by including them in project activities.•To reduce vulnerability of households falling into poverty through decreasing fuel wood scarcity.Thanks to the income that will be generated through certification of the project under the Gold Standard, the high quality improved cook stoves can be sold at a reduced price to make them affordable to the average households. The SAVE 80 stove sets are designed in Germany and assembled locally in Lesotho ."},

Biomass is often the predominant source of energy for cooking and water boiling, especially in rural areas. Cooking is generally carried out on thermally inefficient traditional devices and produces large amounts of smoke and indoor air pollution. The distribution of efficient cook stoves in this Programme will significantly reduce fuel consumption, resulting in an improved living environment for recipients and reduced pressure on local forests, with a reduction in fuel being burnt annually as a result of the project. By reducing fuel consumption, CO2 emissions from combustion of non-renewable biomass will be correspondingly reduced. In addition more than 1 billion people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water and a high percentage these boil their water to purify it for consumption, taking significant amounts of fuel and time. In addition to distributing improved cook stoves, this PoA will also introduce safe water technologies such as boreholes. Clean water technologies avoid the need for water to be treated by boiling, equating to a reduction in CO2 emissions from the combustion of biomass. Boreholes will either be newly installed or repaired and returned to working order but in all cases will be maintained throughout the project life time. Using the concept of suppressed demand, project developers can also obtain credits by supplying clean water to poorer members of society that are not able to use biomass energy to treat their water (usually because they cannot afford it, or because the energy is otherwise unavailable to them). This means that the credits obtained are proportional to the amount of biomass that would have been combusted using traditional technology in order to provide clean water for users. This concept allows for beneficiaries who would otherwise not benefit from the project to be included and supplied with a safe water source."},

Simoshi outsources institutional improved cook stoves (IICS) from the local manufacturer Ugastove and promotes and sells them to schools and institutions. The behavioural transformation Simoshi brings to schools through an effective management of change and subsequent support to the continuous use of the IICS enables both the participating schools and Simoshi to recycle a percentage of the stream of carbon credit returns, to further expand the number of schools that move up in the energy ladder.\r\nSimoshi sells the IICS through payment schemes that include instalment modalities, allowing schools to comfortably pay back their debt throughout the school year, using the money saved from firewood NOT consumed to pay back for the acquired IICS. \r\nSimoshi's strong relationship of trust built with schools through monitoring, on-going staff training and free annual IICS maintenance, are the added on value and innovative project's pillars necessary for the behavioural transition to happen. IICS is a product that is prone to rapid deterioration if not maintained regularly. Nevertheless the annual free service provided to the IICS and the school is crucial in shaping future customer relations, product expectations and ultimately behavioural change. Schools face tremendous financial constrains and attention to the kitchen environment is the least of their priorities. Nevertheless, they play a crucial role in the school finances, the health impact for children and cooks, the deforestation impact and subsequent CO2 emissions"},

The power plant is expected to generate a net energy output of 27.638 GWh per year, estimated on the basis of long-term average wind speeds at the location. Electricity produced is sold to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the national electricity utility, through a dedicated transmission line. The Project has been designated by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as a Small Power Project (SPP), and its operations and sale of electricity are governed by the Permit issued by SLSEA, and the standardised Small Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) signed with CEB. The Permit was issued and the SPPA was executed, before the commencement of construction activities. The SPPA is a standardised, 20-year, non-negotiable contract, and defines a standardised tariff for the sale of electricity on the basis of a generic wind power plant and other financial indices at the time of calculating the tariff by the Authority (SLSEA). This project is the first wind power project in Sri Lanka. The energy generated by the project is to be supplied to the sole purchaser of electricity in the country, the Ceylon Electricity Board. The metering of the generation will take place at the panel room of the project, where all eight WTGs will be connected. The metering of the project is done by the CEB, and at the commissioning of the project, the officials from the CEB will connect the meters for the metering. The project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the following manner. The wind resource potential is converted to electricity using eight wind turbines and electricity is supplied to the national grid, which is fully owned and managed by CEB. Sri Lanka’s electricity generating system feeding the national grid is dominated by thermal power plants, using diesel, fuel oil and naphtha, and is also using coal from year 2011. A range of diesel engines, open cycle gas turbines and combined cycle gas turbines serve the grid, while the first coal-fired power plant in Sri Lanka commenced operation in March 2011 at a site adjacent to this small scale CDM project activity. Energy share in the national grid from fossil-fuelled thermal power plants was 60% in 2007, and is expected to exceed 80% by year 2020. Electricity generated from the Mampuri Wind Power Plant displaces a corresponding portion of fossil fuels used in power plants serving the national grid and avoids the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and coal power plants. The Mampuri Wind Power Plant is estimated to displace 18,768 tCO2 per year at an emission factor of 0.6791 kgCO2 per kWh, as calculated later in this PDD. It also avoids other emissions such as SOx and NOx from thermal power plants located throughout Sri Lanka. The project activity has improved the road along the coast at Mampuri, which has enhanced the mobility of villagers in Mampuri. Several community service initiatives are being implemented by the project participant. Estimated project start date: 23/08/2008"},

Envirofit is the coordinating/ managing entity (CME) for the PoA. The energy – efficient stoves in this VPA also known as improved cook stoves (ICS), are designed by a team of experts, scientists and engineers at Envirofit.In the absence of project activity, the traditional inefficient cook stoves, commonly referred to as chulhas, would have been used for cooking – producing substantial GHG emissions due to burning of non renewable biomass. A large portion of the rural population in India is dependent on traditional biomass chulhas. The most commonly used chulhas are made of mud/clay fixed in a kitchen corner with an opening near the floor for fuel and one or two openings on top to place pots. The use of solid biomass fuels (eg. fuel wood) in these inefficient traditional chulhas – while meeting domestic household needs - releases large amounts of particulate matter into the air, thus causing Indoor Air Pollution .  The programme, by replacing traditional chulhas, solves the Indoor Air Pollution problem by deploying cleaner and greener ICS in addition to reducing GHG emissions."},

Excess electricity is supplied to the grid.The main purpose of the project is to transform the existing low tech sludge treatment processat Kubratovo into a modern advanced treatment process matching the best sludge treatmentpractice available in Western Europe. This transformation has a major effect on the environmentthrough dramatically reducing the existing methane gas emissions at the plant while alsoreducing the volume of sludge (to as much as 50%) that needs to be transported, hencereducing GHG emissions from transportation as well (not included in GHG abatementcalculations).The overall objective of the project is to provide an environmentally friendly sludge treatmentprocess reducing methane and carbon dioxide emissions that – under a business-as-usualscenario – would have continued.Other objectives are:• replace the traditional sludge drying beds and landfill options with mesophilic digestion ofall primary and secondary sludge followed by mechanical dewatering in order to reduceGHG emissions;• effectively mitigate odour problems from the existing treatment of sludge and sludgeliquors through introduction of digestion;• production of fertiliser by mechanical dewatering of the digested stabilised sludge;• production of electricity from utilisation of the biogas in CHP gas engines therebyreducing GHG emissions from electricity production by the grid.The project delivers the following key results:• all primary and secondary sludge thickened and digested as per EU recommendationsand guidelines;• all biogas produced within the digestion process used for power and heat generation viaCHP gas engines thus reducing on-site electricity purchases from the national grid;reduction in on-site fossil fuel usage as all site-heating requirements will be met by theCHP gas engines;• all sludge is stabilised and pathogen free.Long term strategic reductions of GHG emissions include:• reduction in open release of CH4 from open anaerobic sludge tanks and drying beds;• reduction in open release of CH4 from landfill disposal site;• reduction in CO2 emissions due to replacement of electricity production from fossil fuels;• reduction in CO2 emissions due to replacement of heat generation from fossil fuels.The project had been implemented in two stages:- Erection of a new digester system consisting of 4 digesters, 7,000 m3 each, designed,supplied and erected by PASSAVANT ROEDIGER Anlagenbau.For destroying of the excess methane in case of emergency a flaring system have beenimplemented, consisting of 2 x DN150 flares, type ZA1-F2-0/N0 designed andmanufactured by HEGWEIN GmbH, Germany.- Erection of 3 new co-generation sets GE JMS 320 GS-B.LC with 1,063 kW electriccapacity each and 1,088 kW thermal capacity, for generation of electric and thermalenergy by combusting biogas from digesters.The digesters were commissioned at the end of 2006 and started operation on 01 January 2007but due to some technical problems in the adjustment of the biological process the generation ofbiogas was interrupted in the end of June 2007 and resumed on 01 May 2008, so the firstindustrial quantities of biogas were registered in May, 2008.The CHP was commissioned and started generating electricity and thermal energy for plant’sneeds in November, 2009."},

Around 95% of rural population uses biomass fuel for cooking with fuelwood being used in around 85% households . 98% of Bangladesh’s rural population cooks with biomass using traditional stoves, despite years of efforts by governments and health organizations to promote models that are fuel-efficient and have chimneys . The VPA stoves burn fuel more efficiently and are designed to draw off smoke and toxins, thus creating cleaner indoor air for women and children. They have also been shown to use about 50% less fuel to cook the same amount of food.  In the absence of this VPA households would cook primarily using traditional inefficient stoves, perpetuating environmental and health degradation.

The project is owned and operated by Hanbao Livestock & Farming Products Company, Ltd. and implemented on their pig farm in Fangyuan Township, Changhua County, Taiwan. The project involves the capture of biogas from the pig farm’s wastewater treatment facility and the construction of a biogas generation plant to utilize the recovered biogas for electricity production. The project also involves the installation of wind turbines and solar PV. Currently, the biogas generation plant has an installed capacity of 65KW with another 195kw to be installed, for an installed capacity of 260KW. Currently, the solar PV system has an installed capacity of 963KW with another 490KW to be installed, for an installed capacity of 1,453KW. The project will also involve the construction of wind turbines with an installed capacity of 51KW. Thus, the current installed renewable energy capacity is 1,028KW and the future total installed capacity will be 1,764KW. The completed project will produce an estimated 3,776MWh annually. Social and Environmental Benefits(1) Reduced methane emissions – Methane-rich biogas is a byproduct of waste decomposition. In the absence of the project, GHG emissions in the form of methane would be released directly into the atmosphere. The project will prevent methane emissions by capturing the biogas associated with pig waste treatment. (2) Renewable energy generation – The use of wind, solar, and biogas generated electricity neither creates water and air pollution not does it contribute to global climate change. Another benefit of domestic renewable energy is the decreased dependence on increasingly expensive imported fuel, most of which is highly polluting fossil fuel."},

{"id": "585", "gs_id": 3434, "project_details": "GS3434 Uberlândia landfills I and II", "status": "GOLD_STANDARD_CERTIFIED_PROJECT", "project_type": "Biogas - Electricity", "country": "Brazil", "actions": "https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/614", "description": "The objective of the Uberlândia landfills I and II is to collect the landfill gas produced in the Uberlândia Landfill and use it to generate electricity. A total capacity of 2.80 MW will be installed, composed by 2 engines with individual capacity of 1.4 MW each. The project is expected to export 354,968  MWh during its lifetime.Uberlândia Landfill comprises two adjoining solid waste disposal sites (SWDS), named Landfill I and Landfill II, both owned and operated by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. (Project Participant). The Landfill I started operating in July of 1995 and stopped receiving waste in September 2010. The Landfill II started operating in October 2010 with the same environmental care applied to the previous disposal site and counts on a qualified and multidisciplinary team of technicians. The landfill has a total area of 300,000 m2, with 200,000 m2 dedicated to disposal of waste, being able to receive till 4,500,000 m3 of solid waste for an approximately 18 years of lifetime. All the area was sealed with a membrane of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and compacted clay in order to protect the phreatic layer from contamination. The leachate generated in each landfill is given a different treatment. For Landfill I the leachate is treated at an ascendant flow anaerobic reactor followed by an anaerobic filter and then sent to the Uberabinha’s sewage treatment station (ETE Uberabinha) through municipal canalization. The leachate from Landfill II, after being analysed by the Municipal Department of Water and Sewage (Departamento Municipal de Água e Esgoto – DMAE), was authorized to be directly sent to the ETE Uberabinha without previous treatment. In this Project the Landfill I and the Landfill II were considered as a sole SDWS, since the area surrounding the two sites, including them, is owned and operated by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. and they are physically near enough to permit the joint operation. In fact, only a 27 m width road used exclusively for the landfilling operation separates the two sites, and the gas station and power plant of the proposed project activity are planned to be installed on the roadside between the Landfill I and Landfill II. Therefore, the estimative of emissions of methane from SWDS considered the two sites as one single SWDS.The scenario existing prior to the implementation of the Uberlândia landfills I and II project activity at the Uberlândia Landfill is the operation of the landfill with uncontrolled emission of the LFG (landfill gas) generated to the atmosphere, i.e. the LFG generated due to the decomposition of the organic matter is vented through the vertical wells installed at the landfill’s area. As will be demonstrated ahead, the existing scenario and the baseline scenario are the same.Emissions associated with the baseline scenario are the CH4 emissions due to the atmospheric release of the LFG and CO2 emissions due to the power generation from fossil-fuel power-plants. With the implementation of the project, the LFG previously released will be collected through the installation of pipelines and emission reduction will be achieved through the destruction of the gas collected in a flaring system and in the power plant. Additionally, the project will export renewable electricity to the grid, avoiding the dispatch of the same amount of electricity from fossil-fuel based power plants in the Brazilian National Grid.The project will bring benefits to sustainable development, as follows:-Increase of local environmental quality: the project will contribute not only through the avoidance of GHG emissions to the atmosphere, but also by displacing the fossil fuel consumption from power plants connected to the Brazilian Electric Grid. The project might also be seen as a good practice of correct solid waste final disposal;-Labour capaciting / Income generation: the project will need qualified operators to maintain the gas collection wells and pipeline and to operate the degassing station and the power plant. A team composed by engineers and technicians will be created and trained by international consultants and manufacturers. The revenues of these personnel will be above the market, as the technology employed is new in the Uberlândia region;-Integration with different sectors: using LFG to generate electricity is relatively new in Brazil – some projects were developed only under the CDM and only a few of them are indeed generating electricity (like the Bandeirantes Landfill Gas to Energy Project, São João Landfill Gas to Energy Project and Exploitation of the biogas from Controlled Landfill in Solid Waste Management Central – CTRS / BR.040). Therefore, the project will have an enormous contribution over the integration with the electric sectors.Project start date: 03/05/2011This is the date of creation of Energas Geração de Energia Ltda., composed by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. and Asja Brasil Serviços para o Meio Ambiente Ltda. exclusively for the development of the Project."},

The power plant is expected to generate a net energy output of 27.638 GWh per year, estimated on the basis of long-term average wind speeds at the location. Electricity produced is sold to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the national electricity utility, through a dedicated transmission line. The Project has been designated by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as a Small Power Project (SPP), and its operations and sale of electricity are governed by the Permit issued by SLSEA, and the standardised Small Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) signed with CEB. The Permit was issued and the SPPA was executed, before the commencement of construction activities. The SPPA is a standardised, 20-year, non-negotiable contract, and defines a standardised tariff for the sale of electricity on the basis of a generic wind power plant and other financial indices at the time of calculating the tariff by the Authority (SLSEA). This project is the first wind power project in Sri Lanka. The energy generated by the project is to be supplied to the sole purchaser of electricity in the country, the Ceylon Electricity Board. The metering of the generation will take place at the panel room of the project, where all eight WTGs will be connected. The metering of the project is done by the CEB, and at the commissioning of the project, the officials from the CEB will connect the meters for the metering. The project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the following manner. The wind resource potential is converted to electricity using eight wind turbines and electricity is supplied to the national grid, which is fully owned and managed by CEB. Sri Lanka’s electricity generating system feeding the national grid is dominated by thermal power plants, using diesel, fuel oil and naphtha, and is also using coal from year 2011. A range of diesel engines, open cycle gas turbines and combined cycle gas turbines serve the grid, while the first coal-fired power plant in Sri Lanka commenced operation in March 2011 at a site adjacent to this small scale CDM project activity. Energy share in the national grid from fossil-fuelled thermal power plants was 60% in 2007, and is expected to exceed 80% by year 2020. Electricity generated from the Mampuri Wind Power Plant displaces a corresponding portion of fossil fuels used in power plants serving the national grid and avoids the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and coal power plants. The Mampuri Wind Power Plant is estimated to displace 18,768 tCO2 per year at an emission factor of 0.6791 kgCO2 per kWh, as calculated later in this PDD. It also avoids other emissions such as SOx and NOx from thermal power plants located throughout Sri Lanka. The project activity has improved the road along the coast at Mampuri, which has enhanced the mobility of villagers in Mampuri. Several community service initiatives are being implemented by the project participant. Estimated project start date: 23/08/2008"},

Mahasakthi Cooperative Federation encourages independent, sustainable and viable alternative economic institutions of women focussing on women’s leadership, their legal rights and political empowerment. The purpose of the project activity is to set up 6,000 biogas plants (digesters) of 2m3 capacity each for single households having minimum of two cows and place to build biogas digester in four Mandals of Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, and in this way replace Non-Renewable Biomass with biogas for cooking and heating water. A biogas plant of 2 m3 capacity is sufficient to provide cooking fuel to a family of four to five . Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh State is a biomass deficit region . Fuel wood scarcity has an impact directly on rural households, which are highly dependent on this fuel. Demand for fuel wood and logs from commons and forests have caused resource degradation to the extent that collection exceeds sustainable yield. Forest degradation on the other hand leads to fuel wood scarcity leading to unsustainable removal of biomass to meet the demands. The project activity will attenuate the rural thermal energy needs used for cooking and water heating. Each household will install a 2 m3 biogas plant and cattle dung will be put into the anaerobic digester (Deenabandhu biogas Model). The technology is tried and tested in India , and has been in use for many years. By utilizing this cattle dung in a controlled anaerobic digestion and combustion system, biogas will be available for cooking energy and heating water. Biogas will be used on a two-ring gas stove having 4 inch burner, with a flame temperature of 870oC , supplied as part of the project activity. Implementation of the project depends on the successful validation and registration as a CDM project activity since the project will be financed completely from carbon revenues. After the project is registered as a CDM activity, carbon forward funding will enable the construction of domestic bio-digesters. An end user agreement will be signed between the PP, the Mahasakthi MAC Samakhya Ltd and the end user after construction, wherein the end user is aware of emission reductions from the use of biogas, and are willing to give up their rights and transfer the credit ownership to the Project Proponent, the Mahasakthi MAC Samakhya Ltd. Each household will feed cattle dung into the anaerobic digester which is a renewable source. The methane from the digester will be burnt to generate thermal energy thus replacing non-renewable firewood.

Such stoves are considered non-efficient and require large amount of charcoal to operate which translate into a significant cost for the user. More than 1.4 million tons of charcoal is this way used each year.  This  over-consumption  is  not  sustainable  and  is  an  important  reason  behind  the  acute deforestation and soil erosion problems found in this country. On top of that, emissions of greenhouse gas resulting from the burning of charcoal, significantly participate to the global problem that is climate change. To deal with this issue, the French NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde launched a new program called PALMIS Enèji with the objective to facilitate access to cleaner, more modern and cheaper sources of energy for all.  This  program  works  as  a  social  micro-franchise  that  distribute  more  efficient  charcoal cookstoves,  LGP  cookstoves  and  solar  lanterns.  PALMIS Enèji is developing its own distribution network with the objective of making those products easily available to all. A new microcredit financial product is also  being  developed  with  the  support  of  ID  Microfinance  (a  local  microfinance  institution  and  also  a program  of  Entrepreneurs  du  Monde)  to  help  people  with  limited  financial  means  to  have  to  access  to those products. Finally, PALMIS Enèji is trying to increase the level of awareness in local populations about the described issues and the advantages of those products by creating communication tools tailored to the local context.  The  next  step  will  very  likely  be  the  creation  of  a  social  enterprise  in  order  to  assure  the sustainability of its social mission: to distribute as much as possible energy products in Haiti. The project activity  “Expanding LPG access in Haiti through microfinance services\"  is in phase with this approach since  it aims to promote the use of LPG as a source  of  energy  for  cooking,  thus  limiting  the  usage  of  charcoal  and  thus  reducing  emissions  of greenhouse gas. Other  than  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  helping  fighting  deforestation,  this project  also  offers  the  possibility  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  toxic  gas  such  as  carbon  monoxide  inside households.

The baseline scenario was identified using data from a large scale national survey published by the  United Nations Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (UN-CEPAL), report titled Consumo de Leña en Honduras (April 2011).  This report shows that on average 69% of interviewed households used firewood as input for cooking food, and over 60% of baseline stove models are traditional designs that use woodfuel.  This SSC-CPA aims to provide both climate and livelihood benefits to the large population of Honduran households currently using inefficient biomass burning stoves.Several greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, are produced as a result of the combustion of non-renewable biomass as used in cooking stoves.  ICS improve heat transfer efficiency as compared to the baseline conventional stoves, thereby reducing both the amount of wood fuel used by unit appliance implemented and the emission of GHGs.  In addition to direct climate benefits, this SSC-CPA achieves several co-benefits that contribute to sustainable development:Environmental BenefitsThe project reduces the demand for biomass required for cooking stoves thus reducing the rate of deforestation connected to wood consumption. In addition, the reduction in use of less efficient stoves will yield a reduction in emissions from fuel combustion thus improving air quality and reducing the emission of harmful gases that contribute to climate change.Social and economic benefitsProject beneficiaries using the ICS reduce their wood consumption. The reduction in fuel needs will also save project beneficiaries time and income. This means that biomass users who gather wood will see a reduction in the amount that they have to collect, leaving that time available for other activities. Biomass users that purchase their fuel will be able to direct more of their income to other needs.  From the economic perspective, the project will contribute to the scale-up of local businesses and organizations, with the potential to create jobs in retail, marketing and distribution."},

Water-borne disease is a leading cause of illness in the developing world, contributing to the death of two million children every year, on average. Providing safe drinking water to additional households/communities will have a significant impact on child mortality. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target aims to halve the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking-water. Strides have been made in improving access to safe drinking water and the world is projected to exceed this target. Nevertheless, by 2015, there will still be 672 million people who will not have access to improved drinking water.

Around 30% of Lao population lacks access to a source of improved drinking water and are at risk of getting diarrhoea or other water borne diseases. Though, a significant fraction of Lao population treats water preferable by boiling using woody biomass, charcoal etc to make the water safe for drinking. There is a significant fraction of families even cannot afford firewood to boil water, hence are forced to continue to drink unsafe water.\r\nTerraClear is a social enterprise, registered as a private limited company under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The enterprise is in the business of getting clean water to more people in Laos by selling the Lao Ceramic Water Purifier (CWP) to the population. CWP’s help people access safe drinking water, especially in rural areas, reduce time spent provisioning drinking water or collecting wood, reduce costs for families, reduce child and adult morbidity and mortality, improving attendance at school and increased productivity. Ceramic Water Purifiers provide for removal of microorganisms from water by gravity filtration through porous ceramics, with a typical flow rate at production of 1.5 - 3 litres per hour.  Originally TerraClear plans to sell over 100,000 CWP’s between 2012 and 2019 but this target seems a bit high as up to mid-2018, the total sale is just about 58,000 filters. It is estimated that by the end of its first crediting period (15th July 2019), the total sale would be about 67,000 CWPs.\r\n \r\nWith the new target, CWPs will provide safe drinking water for potentially more than 0.3 million people, and at the same time reduce the demand for water treatment through boiling water with non- renewable biomass. The CWP’s have a useful life of 5 years or more provided proper care and maintenance. The Lao Ceramic Water Purifiers are manufactured locally in Laos and therefore contribute to building a local industry and value added in Laos, as well as creating much needed sustainable jobs and business opportunities in rural areas. The project start date is 06/06/2012.  With the assistance of carbon finance, TerraClear can become a unique and on-going sustainable enterprise capable of providing emissions-free household water treatment options to rural households, and thereby improve public health, household welfare and economy, as well as contribute to reduced deforestation in Lao PDR."},

Indeed, eighty-four (84) per cent of households use wood and charcoal on a daily basis. For that reason, there is a growing pressure on forests and the country currently looses 105,000 hectares of forested land every year according to the Ministry in charge of environmental issues (“Ministère de l’environnement et du développement durable\"). High efficiency improved cookstoves and gas stoves help fight deforestation by significantly reducing the demand for wood and charcoal, and thus contribute to a global reduction in GHG emissions from biomass combustion. To deal with this issue, the French NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde launched a new program called Nafa Naana with the objective to facilitate access to cleaner, more modern and cheaper sources of energy for all. Nafa Naana takes place in the context of the National Plan for the Environment (PANE) established in 1991 by the Government of Burkina Faso, and is financially supported by the Ministry of Mines, Quarries and Energy. Nafa Naana  works  as  a  social  micro-franchise  that  distributes  more  efficient  charcoal and wood stoves,  LGP  stoves  and  solar  lanterns.  Nafa Naana is developing its own distribution network with the objective of making those products easily available to all. Financial services are offered to Nafa Naana clients either as group loans or individual loans to help  people  with  limited  financial  means  access those products. Finally, Nafa Naana is trying to increase the level of awareness in local populations about the described issues and the advantages of those products by creating communication tools tailored to the local context.  The  next  step  will  very  likely  be  the  creation  of  a  social  enterprise  in  order  to  assure  the sustainability of its social mission: to distribute as many energy products as possible in Burkina Faso. The project activity  “Expanding access to LPG in Burkina Faso through microfranchised distribution\"  is in phase with this approach since  it aims to promote the use of LPG as a source  of  energy  for  cooking,  thus  limiting  the  usage  of  wood  and  thus  reducing  emissions  of greenhouse gas. Other  than  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  helping  fight  deforestation,  this project  also  offers  the  possibility  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  toxic  fumes  such  as  carbon  monoxide and PM 2.5 inside the homes of the beneficiary population. Indeed, the combustion of wood with traditional stoves releases toxic fumes in the air. These toxic fumes are one of the main causes of respiratory diseases among women and children.  Finally,  the  use  of  LGP  cookstoves,  instead  of   traditional  ones,  means  that the  end  user  is  saving significant amounts of money because fuel expenses per gram of food cooked are lower for LPG than for wood when the wood is purchased by the user."},
